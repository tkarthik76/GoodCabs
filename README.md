# ðŸš• GoodCabs: Tackling Seasonality in Tier-2 Mobility

## ðŸ›º Background
GoodCabs, founded in 2023, is a fast-growing ride-hailing startup focused on Indiaâ€™s tier-2 cities, providing affordable transport options and empowering local drivers with sustainable income opportunities. Operating in 10+ cities, the company is working toward ambitious performance and satisfaction goals in 2024.

## ðŸš§ Problem Statement
As operations scaled, seasonality emerged as the biggest roadblock to consistent revenue growth. In June 2024, GoodCabs faced its steepest revenue drop of â‚¹1.2 million, triggered by a sharp decline in ride demand driven by seasonal shifts.

Like global players such as Uber and Grab, GoodCabs faces challenges tied to seasonal fluctuations in rider behaviorâ€”including academic calendars, holidays, and regional activity patternsâ€”making demand forecasting difficult across smaller urban markets.

**How can GoodCabs design a predictive, data-driven strategy to minimize the effects of seasonality, stabilize revenue, and uphold its mission of empowering local drivers in tier-2 cities?**
