# ðŸš• GoodCabs: Tackling Seasonality in Tier-2 Mobility


## ðŸ›º Background
**GoodCabs**, founded in 2023, is a fast-growing **ride-hailing** startup focused on **Indiaâ€™s tier-2 cities**, providing affordable transport options and **empowering local drivers with sustainable income opportunities**. Operating in 10 cities, the company is working toward ambitious performance and satisfaction goals in 2024.


## ðŸš§ Problem Statement
As operations scaled, **seasonality** emerged as the biggest roadblock to consistent revenue growth. In **June 2024**, **GoodCabs faced its steepest revenue drop of â‚¹1.2 million, triggered by a sharp decline in ride demand driven by seasonal shifts**.

Like global players such as Uber and Grab, GoodCabs faces challenges tied to seasonal fluctuations in rider behaviorâ€”including academic calendars, holidays, and regional activity patternsâ€”making demand forecasting difficult across smaller urban markets.

**How can GoodCabs design a predictive, data-driven strategy to minimize the effects of seasonality, stabilize revenue, and uphold its mission of empowering local drivers in tier-2 cities?**


## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
The Goodcabs database comprises eight tables: `Dim_city`, `Dim_date`, `Fact_trips`, `Fact_Passenger_summary`,`Dim_repeat_trip_distribution`,`City_target_passenger_rating`, `Monthly_target_new_passengers`,`Monthly_target_trips` among others, totaling approximately 425,000 rows.
